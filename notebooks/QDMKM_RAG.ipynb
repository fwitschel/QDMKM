However, your case is not one where we can grant an extension - it comes very late and the problem was known for a long time so that you could have taken appropriate countermeasures in due time (e.g. using a different method instead of a survey). We are looking forward to receiving your master thesis on Thursday. Best regards, The Dean ---- Dear Prof, I would like to ask for a deadline extension for my master thesis. I really got into trouble because of the poor response rate for the survey that I did in the beginning of my thesis. It meant that I had to do the survey again and I spent a lot of time convincing people to participate. All this was not planned...
