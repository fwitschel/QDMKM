Since your sickness occurred during a non-critical period of your thesis work and was comparatively short, there was enough time to resolve issues resulting from it. We are looking forward to receiving your thesis submission on June 21st. Best regards, The Dean. ---- Dear Prof. Dean, please find attached the certificate for my sickness. Hoping for a positive decision, best regards, Jane Smith. ---- Dear Ms Smith, could you please send us a medical certificate for your sick period. Please note that this does not imply that we will grant the extension, it is just a routine request. Thanks and best regards, The Dean. --- Dear Prof. Dean, I am writing to you to ask for a deadline extension of 1 week for my master thesis. In February, I had a really bad flu from which it took me two weeks to recover. I feel that I am still suffering from the consequences since my whole thesis plan got mixed up during that period - where I was in a great flow before analysing the literature, I felt I had to start from scratch after my sickness. Now, I am behind, but feel that an additional week would allow me to deliver good results. I hope you understand my situatiuon. Thank you and best regards, Jane",yes

Please make sure to submit your document until August 4th, midnight. Best regards, The Dean. ---- Hi Dean, I'd like to request a deadline extension for my master thesis. Due to very unfortunate circumstances, I will not be able to deliver results until June 21st: in March, I was sick for 8 days (please find attached the medical certificate). Although that may not seem long, it destroyed my entire planning. That is because I had scheduled a focus groups with experts in that week - an important milestone in the methodology of my thesis. I had to cancel that focus group meeting because of my sickness and when I had recovered, it proved very difficult to find another common date with all the required experts. I was able to replace one person with another one with better availability, but one really important expert could not join the focus group until early June. Since I had to wait for the results of the focus group, I was blocked. I would have notified you earlier, but I always thought I could find an earlier date for the focus group - which finally did not work... I really hope you can understand my problem! Thank you, John Doe",yes

In April, I was given the opportunity to take over a new role with new responsibilities in my job. I gladly accepted that because it really advances my career. On the downside, I was overwhelmed with my new duties and could not work on the thesis as expected. Could you make an exception for me so that I can finish my work?

Please make sure to submit your document until August 4th, midnight. ---- Dear Mr Dean, I would like to request an extension of my thesis deadline. Two weeks ago, I was informed that my company sends me on a mission abroad. According to my working contract, the company is allowed to do that in exceptional circumstances. I attach the contract so that you can study it. But to be honest, I do not see any such circumstances - a colleague of mine, who was foreseen for that mission, dropped out already a year ago and no-one made an effort to replace her. Now I have to step in. The nature of the mission and the circumstances abroad (including working in places with no secured internet connection) will make it hard if not impossible for me to finish my thesis in time. If you granted me a 2 week extension, then I could finish everything in time when I come back. Thanks a lot, kind regards, Tom",yes

We have these cases regularly and we try to help, but since the circumstances that you describe are to be expected, it would be unfair towards all the others who did not get extensions under the same circumstances. We can offer you to keep your thesis topic and work on it for another year so that you graduate only in 2020. Please let me know whether you want to go that way or whether you will submit in June this year. Thanks and best regards, The Dean. ---- Dear Prof, well you know, my parents wanted to help me with the child, but it did not work most of the time for different reasons. And my little girl was crying and sick much more than I had expected. Now it is getting better and I feel that an extension by 3 weeks would allow me to finish. Regards, Lisa ---- Dear Ms Little, you write that nothing went to plan. Can you please describe whether you had specific plans that did not work and why that was the case? Thanks and best regards, The Dean ---- Dear Prof, can you please extend my master thesis deadline? In February my child was born and since then, nothing has been going to plan. I was not able to work on the thesis as expected and need more time. Thanks for helping me! Lisa",no

Please make sure to submit your thesis until August 4th, midnight. Regards, The Dean ---- Dear Dean, I'm sorry that I have to trouble you with this, but I have had a lot of unexpected trouble in the last months which prevents me from submitting my thesis on time. Last year in October, our little baby boy was born. We had planned everything around that (my thesis plan had included a two-month break and we had organised a day care as well as a break for my partner between January and March). But then, my mother got very sick and since she is alone, I had to go home and take care of her. I include the medical certificate for her sickness. I tried to catch up all the work after my return, but it was too much for the few hours that remain each day when my child is in daycare. Please help! Best regards, Berta",yes

However, your case is not one where we can grant an extension - it comes very late and the problem was known for a long time so that you could have taken appropriate countermeasures in due time (e.g. using a different method instead of a survey). We are looking forward to receiving your master thesis on Thursday. Best regards, The Dean ---- Dear Prof, I would like to ask for a deadline extension for my master thesis. I really got into trouble because of the poor response rate for the survey that I did in the beginning of my thesis. It meant that I had to do the survey again and I spent a lot of time convincing people to participate. All this was not planned... Would be great to hear from you, best regards, Greg",no

There are enough possibilities to secure/backup your work; I'd also expect that some copy of an intermediate version must have been sent to your supervisor?

Please submit your thesis until August 4 midnight. Best regards, The Dean ---- Dear Ms FormerDean, can you please consider extending the deadline of my master thesis? I am working with a company and since the beginning, the collaboration was difficult. Interviews had to be re-scheduled several times and when it was finally agreed which data to use for my analysis (which was only in February), it took the company another two months to make the data available. I wrote them reminders all the time and tried to adapt my plan, but they always told me that it would arrive soon etc. In the end, I received the data in late April - and this was when I could actually start working on the thesis. I also had to clarify some questions regarding the data - again, I had to wait for weeks for a response, during which time I was again blocked. Now, everything is clarified and I feel that with another two weeks time, I will be able to successfully complete the thesis. Thanks for your support in advance, best regards, Pete Purple",no

Inconclusive results are always a risk in research - it is ok to end up with partially unclear conclusions.

If your arguments are sound, you will not fail. All the best, The Dean ---- Dear Mr Dean, I'm sorry to bother you with it, but I need to ask for a deadline extension for my master thesis. The probem is that my evaluation has gone totally wrong. I planned it together with my supervisor and developed what we both thought was a useful questionnaire - but the results that I have now obtained are totally inconclusive. With these results, I am afraid to fail my master thesis. I think I have now understood how to formulate some questions more clearly - if you give me the opportunity to run the survey again (a two week extension would suffice), I believe that I will have some useful results.

All the best, The Dean ---- Dear Prof, I am writing to you in a desperate situation, hoping that you can help. Maybe you know that I had a grant when I came here to study. I was relying on the grant because I do not have any financial reserves and wanted to study full-time. Two weeks ago, my grant was unexpectedly canceled - the foundation did not provide any actual reasons, they say that they can do this according to their statutes (see scan of letter attached). Because of my lack of savings, I had to quickly find a job to finance my living. I found one, but now I have to work a lot of overtime and will not get vacation until June. This really destroyed my thesis plans... Since I will be able to take vacation in mid June, I think I could finish the thesis then - but only if I can have another one or two weeks to work on it.
